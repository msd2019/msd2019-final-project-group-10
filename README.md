# Final Project for Modeling Social Data, 2019

<  Thanaspakorn Niyomkarn, Alex Li Kong, and Sang Won Lee (tn2381, alk2225, and sl4447) >

This repository has code to attempt to replicate and extend the results in < CHILLING EFFECTS: ONLINE SURVEILLANCE AND WIKIPEDIA USE > by < Jonathon W. Penney >, < Berkeley Technology Law Journal>.

A complete report of our results is in `02_final_report.pdf`, which can be generated by cloning this repository and running `make` to execute the commands in the `Makefile` file. All data are in `data/` and any original source code provided by the authors is in `authors_original_code/`.

The repository is structured as follows:

1. `01_get_all_data.sh` gets the original data used by the authors and places a copy in `data/` It also gets new data used for our extended research. 
2. `02_final_report.Rmd` analysis both the original and new data to replicate and extend the results of the original paper, and produces the final report `02_final_report.pdf`
